This project is a simple UI clone of the WhatsApp application built using Flutter. The app is designed to replicate the basic interface of WhatsApp, including a TabBar with icons and text, a customizable AppBar, and screens for Chats, Status, and Calls. The app leverages Flutter's material design widgets to create a clean and responsive UI.

## Features
- **AppBar with Custom Actions**: Includes search functionality, a popup menu with options, and a title.
- **TabBar**: Contains four tabs for Camera, Chats, Status, and Calls. The tabs feature both icons and text, with customizable indicator line properties.
- **ListView.builder**: Each screen (Chats, Status, and Calls) uses `ListView.builder` to dynamically generate the content based on a given item count.
- **Customizable CircleAvatar**: Circle avatars are used for profile pictures, and they include a border for the status screen.
